1) Develop a program which contains this functionalities

- User Enter Number Of players In TextField
- User Enter Number Of Coins in TextField
- The Coins Will have Random Value Between 1 to 100
- Divide Coins Between Players In Sequence
- Display Which Player Has Maximum  Number Of Coins
- Display Which Player has maximum Coin Value
- Display All Player With Number Of Coins And Total Value Of Coins
- No internet is required for this task
